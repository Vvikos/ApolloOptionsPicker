*** This branch is meant to be used to deploy the ApolloOptionsPicker application into a .Appimage

*** To create standalone executable you have to

	(1) Go on the 'master' branch and 'qmake' then 'make'
	(2) Copy the generated executable somewhere you can re-use it (because you'll have to switch branch)
	(3) Paste the executable into AOPdeploy and execute 'sh deploy.sh'
	(4) A standalone executable should have been generated in the current folder
